Its really just the combination of:
a sprite renderer, (tutorials everywhere)
a basic 2D box collision system, (tutorials everywhere)
and an input buffer system to detect combos. (tutorials everywhere)
What needs explaining? 2D Fighting games are almost all the same from a design standpoint. The complicated part is just the art, animations, and the balancing of the characters and movesets.
